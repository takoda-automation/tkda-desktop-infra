# Takoda local desktop deployment

This repository uses `ORESoftware/ores-compose` for the declared laptop/desktop lifecycle.

## Local orchestration

```sh
ores-compose check .ores-compose.yaml
ores-compose plan .ores-compose.yaml
ores-compose up .ores-compose.yaml
```

Stop it from another terminal with:

```sh
ores-compose down .ores-compose.yaml
```

The manifest pins an exact 40-hex desktop-daemon commit under `tmp/dev`, builds it before startup, executes the built release binary directly, and binds the daemon only to the loopback address recorded in `appliance.json`.

Takoda intentionally needs no inbound Cloudflare Tunnel: the daemon establishes an outbound authenticated WebSocket to the hosted control plane. Before startup, set TKDA_AGENT_URL, TKDA_AGENT_ID, TKDA_AGENT_TOKEN_FILE, and TKDA_LOCAL_CONTROL_TOKEN_FILE; ores-compose fails closed if any are missing.

## Cloudflare boundary

A dedicated/static/public IP is not required. Cloudflare account/API credentials must never be copied to an end-user machine or committed here.

For appliances marked `cloudflare.mode = "gated"`, `appliance.json` records the intended loopback origin and hostname/token metadata, but this repository intentionally does **not** ship a runnable `.ores-compose.public.yaml`. Promotion requires both:

1. the real public origin to be started by the declared local lifecycle; and
2. a remote authentication boundary distinct from the daemon's privileged local-control bearer.

For `cloudflare.mode = "not-required"`, the product uses an outbound authenticated agent path and does not need inbound tunneling.

## Reproducibility gate

The daemon source is commit-pinned, but the pinned daemon repository does not currently commit a `Cargo.lock`. Therefore `promotion_gates.daemon_lockfile_committed` remains false and this candidate must not be described as fully transitive-dependency reproducible.

Before stable promotion, commit the daemon lockfile, change the build to `cargo build --locked --release`, and make CI enforce it.

## Upgrade model

Upgrades change the immutable daemon source commit only after upstream review/CI. Mutable `latest` refs are forbidden.
